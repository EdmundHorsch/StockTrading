These python files constitute a data-gathering and back-testing system for an algorithmic stock trading simulation. "Table of Contents" for files:
get_data.py: Contains functions to gather price data, save to storage, and load to memory.
indicators.py: Contains function to calculate techincal indicators.
test_functions.py: Contains functions used to evaluate a potential investment, simulate a trading strategy over a period of time and for a set of stock symbols, and run a random experiment using the given trading strategy.

IN THE FUTURE - I plan to add many more technical indicators (soon/ongoing), a MUCH more sophisticated evaluation function(soon-ish), and funtionality to allow the trading algorithm to run in real-time and execute real trades(lowest priority, distant goal).
